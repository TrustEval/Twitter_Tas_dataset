# Twitter_Tas_dataset
This is the dataset used for our research project: Trust Evaluation on Twitter. 

The proposed Co-Rank method and detailed experimental results can be found in our paper: 

## "CoRank A Coupled Dual Networks Approach to Trust Evaluation on Twitter" (WISE 2018).

There are four files storing the Twitter data crawled from Twitter using its official REST API.

## 'tas_users' 
This is the file storing all the users in the dataset, we have given each user a user index and the UserID is their original user ID collected from Twitter. These users are crawled based on the 'location' attribute in their profile. They are considered all from the Tasmania Twitter Community.
